The repository comprises code examples for some tasks in machine learning, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

MLP_assign_ : This file contains the code to perform a classification task on the MNIST dataset using stochastic gradient descent. I have used the scikit learn library to preprocess the data and fit SGD classifiers by tuning different hyperparameters. The loss curves generated at various stages of training are plotted and compared for performance.
